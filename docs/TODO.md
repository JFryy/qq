## TODO

* test changes only via develop gha
* version flag update
* push to homebrew / AUR / dockerhub
* Support for HTML
* Support for excel family
* TUI View fixes on large files
* TUI Autocompletion improvements (back/forward/based on partial content of path rather than dorectly iterating through splatted gron like paths)
* csv codec improvements: list of maps by default, more agressive heurestics for parsing.
* colorizing gron
* Support slurp and many other flags of jq that are useful.
* Support for protobuff
* more complex tests (but still keep the cli tests) with post-conversion/query type assertions
* (maybe) consider RE so jq paths can be grepped in one command?
